  <h1>About Me-Mukudzei Chisenwa</h1>
  <img src="images/Mukudzei Prof pic.jpg" alt="Mukudzei Chisenwa" id="profile-pic">

<p>Hello! My name is <strong>Mukudzei Chisenwa</strong>. I'm currently learning web development and recently completed a
    JavaScript class where I learned how to enhance webpages with interactivity and dynamic behavior. My goal is to
    become a professional web developer, and the JavaScript class has played a big role in helping me move closer to
    that goal. Taking this course introduced me to many essential web development skills and technologies. I learned how
    to create clean, well-structured interactive HTML pages and apply CSS to style them beautifully. I learned to write
    JavaScript to make my web pages interactive and dynamic.</p>

  <p>Some of the technologies and techniques I learned include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>JavaScript functions and event handling</li>
      <li>jQuery for DOM manipulation</li>
      <li>Form validation and animations</li>
      <li>Responsive design using CSS</li>
    </ul>
  

  <p>This class has helped me understand how to make websites more interactive, which will be a key skill as I pursue a career in front-end development. I'm excited to continue improving my skills and building more complex projects.</p>
